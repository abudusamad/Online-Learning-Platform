An online learning platform is a digital space that allows course creators to market, sell, and deliver their eLearning courses. They’re often referred to as “online course marketplaces.” Like traditional schools, such platforms offer learners a safe environment in which to learn, access course materials, and, in many cases, interact with both teachers and students alike. They offer a wide range of features, including, but not limited to lectures, assignments, quizzes, learning interactions, completion certificates, and social forums/chats.

So, in a way, “learning platform” is kind of a catchall term for both businesses and learners. They help you create, catalog, market, and accept payment for your courses, while also providing all the tools and educational resources that learners need under one roof.
